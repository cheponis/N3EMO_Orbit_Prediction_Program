Bob Berger's Orbital Prediction Program, ever so slightly tweaked to use modern C.

Also includes his "nasa2kep.c" program to convert 2-line NASA elements (e.g. of the type distributed by the ARRL / AMSAT) into a more human-readable 'kepler.dat' file that the orbit program reads directly.

There is a sample "w3vc.sit" - 'site' file giving coordinates & elevation to the orbit program.

A sample 2-line element file and a kepler.dat file can be used to test your compiles.
